# Lifecycle for operating systems
{: #product-lifecycle-classic}

In the lifecycle of a product, end of support (EOS) is the last date that {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} delivers standard support for a version or release of a product. The end of support date is aligned to the vendor and community support dates. It's also the effective date that the product ceases to exist (is deprecated) and can no longer be ordered or purchased. See the following information for AT&T vRouterO operating system EOS dates. 
{: shortdesc}

AT&T vRouter is updated regularly, with the previous release deprecating when a new version is released. For more information, see [About the VRA](/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-about-the-vra).
