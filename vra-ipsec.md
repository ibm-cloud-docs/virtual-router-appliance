# Setting up an IPsec tunnel that works with zone firewalls
{: #setting-up-an-ipsec-tunnel-that-works-with-zone-firewalls}

In previous versions of {{site.data.keyword.vra_full}}, IPsec tunnels that used policy-based routing did not work well with zone firewalls. With version 18.01, a new set of commands addresses this issue, by using "virtual feature points" to enable the traffic from designated tunnels. The feature point acts as an interface that provides an endpoint to include in a zone policy configuration.
{: shortdesc}

The following example provides the configuration of two machines with IPsec between them:

## Machine A
{: #machine-a}

```sh
vyatta@acs-jmat-migsim01:~$ show configuration commands | grep ipsec
set security vpn ipsec esp-group ESP01 pfs 'enable'
set security vpn ipsec esp-group ESP01 proposal 1 encryption 'aes256'
set security vpn ipsec esp-group ESP01 proposal 1 hash 'sha2_512'
set security vpn ipsec ike-group IKE01 proposal 1 dh-group '2'
set security vpn ipsec ike-group IKE01 proposal 1 encryption 'aes256'
set security vpn ipsec ike-group IKE01 proposal 1 hash 'sha2_512'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 50.23.177.59 authentication pre-shared-secret '********'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 50.23.177.59 default-esp-group 'ESP01'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 50.23.177.59 ike-group 'IKE01'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 50.23.177.59 local-address '169.47.243.43'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 50.23.177.59 tunnel 1 local prefix '172.16.200.1/30'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 50.23.177.59 tunnel 1 remote prefix '172.16.100.1/30'
```

## Machine B
{: #machine-b}

```sh
vyatta@acs-jmat-1801-1a:~$ show configuration commands | grep ipsec
set security vpn ipsec esp-group ESP01 pfs 'enable'
set security vpn ipsec esp-group ESP01 proposal 1 encryption 'aes256'
set security vpn ipsec esp-group ESP01 proposal 1 hash 'sha2_512'
set security vpn ipsec ike-group IKE01 proposal 1 dh-group '2'
set security vpn ipsec ike-group IKE01 proposal 1 encryption 'aes256'
set security vpn ipsec ike-group IKE01 proposal 1 hash 'sha2_512'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 169.47.243.43 authentication pre-shared-secret 'iamsecret'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 169.47.243.43 default-esp-group 'ESP01'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 169.47.243.43 ike-group 'IKE01'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 169.47.243.43 local-address '50.23.177.59'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 169.47.243.43 tunnel 1 local prefix '172.16.100.1/30'
set security vpn ipsec site-to-site peer 169.47.243.43 tunnel 1 remote prefix '172.16.200.1/30'
```

This configuration sets up a generic tunnel that routes `172.16.x.x` traffic between the two machines. Machine B has `172.16.100.1` as a loopback address to provide an endpoint to test with, while Machine A has a virtual machine on a routed VLAN to provide source traffic across the tunnel.

You can see the results here:

```sh
[root@acs-jmat-migserver ~]# ping -c 5 172.16.100.1
PING 172.16.100.1 (172.16.100.1) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

This example illustrates bidirectional traffic across this IPsec tunnel. Next, you can apply a simple "allow all" zone policy to all interfaces on Machine A:

```sh
set security firewall name ALLOWALL default-action 'drop'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 10 action 'accept'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 10 protocol 'tcp'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 10 state 'enable'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 20 action 'accept'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 20 protocol 'icmp'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 20 state 'enable'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 30 action 'accept'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 30 protocol 'udp'
set security firewall name ALLOWALL rule 30 state 'enable'
```

Then, add policies between all three interfaces:

```sh
set security zone-policy zone INTERNET interface 'dp0bond1'
set security zone-policy zone INTERNET to PRIVATE firewall 'ALLOWALL'
set security zone-policy zone INTERNET to SERVERS firewall 'ALLOWALL'
set security zone-policy zone PRIVATE interface 'dp0bond0'
set security zone-policy zone PRIVATE to INTERNET firewall 'ALLOWALL'
set security zone-policy zone PRIVATE to SERVERS firewall 'ALLOWALL'
set security zone-policy zone SERVERS interface 'dp0bond0.1341'
set security zone-policy zone SERVERS to INTERNET firewall 'ALLOWALL'
set security zone-policy zone SERVERS to PRIVATE firewall 'ALLOWALL'
```

After the policies are applied, traffic no longer flows, despite being set to `allow all`.
