# Migration overview
{: #migration-overview}

Legacy Vyatta 5400 customers should migrate to {{site.data.keyword.vra_full}} (VRA) as soon as possible, because support for Vyatta 5400 was removed as of March 31, 2019. For more information, see the [Vyatta 5400 end of support announcement](/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-vyatta-5400-end-of-support-announcement).

## How upgrading can benefit you
{: #how-upgrading-can-benefit-you}

In addition to a variety of new features and capabilities that IBM's {{site.data.keyword.vra_full}} brings to the table, there are a number of improvements it provides. See the [FAQs](/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-faqs-for-ibm-virtual-router-appliance#what-improvements-does-the-virtual-router-appliance-vyatta-5600-have-over-the-vyatta-5400-) for more details.
{: shortdesc}

Upgrading to a new device has a different configuration from the Vyatta 5400. As a result, a Vyatta 5400 configuration (file) cannot transfer to your new appliance.
