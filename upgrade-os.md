# Upgrading the OS

{: help}

Upgrading the VRA operating system can be performed with the command `add system image` on a local ISO file uploaded by our {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} Support team. A list of available Vyatta upgrade versions can be obtained using the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Support case system.
{: shortdesc}

To begin the upgrade process, open an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Support case requesting an upload of the latest stable ISO image to your system. You receive a case update from IBM Support (ACS-Security) indicating where the ISO file was uploaded. In the following example, it is in the directory `tmp`, but it is commonly uploaded to `/home/vyatta`.

The upgrade process illustrated in this example is for a single VRA. If you are using VRA in high availability mode, you must run the same upgrade command on both systems. Furthermore, it is recommended that you upgrade the `BACKUP` machine first, and verify that it is working properly. Then access the `MASTER` machine and fail it over using the `reset vrrp` command. Finally, upgrade the original `MASTER` after the `BACKUP` has taken control.
{: important}

To upgrade the VRA, perform the following procedure.

1. Run the command `add system image <Local ISO File>`.
2. Press **Enter** to accept the default name of the ISO image, or enter your own.
3. Select **Yes** to save the current configuration directory and configuration file. 

    Choosing **No** will erase your configuration.
    {: important}
    
5. Choose whether to save the SSH host keys from your current configuration.
6. Press **Enter** to accept the default system console, or enter your own.
7. Press **Enter** to accept the default console speed, or enter your own.
8. Enter the command `reboot` and then enter `Yes` to reboot the machine.
9. If you are using VRA in a high availability mode, run step 1 to step 7 again on the second machine.

The following example illustrates the upgrade process.

```sh
vyatta@vra01:~$ show version | grep Version
Version:      5.2R5S3

vyatta@vra01:~$ add system image /tmp/vyatta-vrouter-5.2R5S4_amd64.iso
