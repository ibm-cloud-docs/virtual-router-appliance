# Vyatta 5400 end of support announcement
{: #vyatta-5400-end-of-support-announcement}

Support for the legacy Vyatta 5400 offering will end on March 31, 2019. This date is largely driven by the fact that the underlying Debian 7 software kernel that the Vyatta 5400 code is built on will no longer have Debian community support.
{: shortdesc}

After March 31, 2019, the vendor for Vyatta 5400 (AT&T, who acquired the Vyatta product line from Brocade in 2017) will no longer provide any code patches or accept support escalations for the device.

Customers using the Vyatta 5400 should migrate to an alternative solution (such as the {{site.data.keyword.vra_full}} (“VRA”; based on the Vyatta 5600) or the IBM Juniper vSRX offering) prior to March 31, 2019.   

For existing customers, the Configuration Conversion service is no longer subsidized by IBM. Customers can submit a request for a quote by sending an e-mail to Wanclouds at services@wanclouds.net with the subject: "Request for Vyatta 5400 Configuration Conversion."

Customers requiring assistance with “hands on” migration tasks can reach out to our IBM Cloud Migration Professional Services by e-mailing ibmcte@us.ibm.com. IBM Cloud has also worked to identify qualified IBM Business Partners who can provide assistance. These engagements will be on a fee-based model, through a direct contract between the customer and the Business Partner.
