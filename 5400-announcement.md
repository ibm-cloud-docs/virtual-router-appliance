# Vyatta 5400 end of support announcement
{: #vyatta-5400-end-of-support-announcement}

Support for the legacy Vyatta 5400 offering that ended on 31 March 2019. This is because the underlying Debian 7 software kernel that the Vyatta 5400 code is built on no longer has Debian community support.
{: shortdesc}

After 31 March 2019, the vendor for Vyatta 5400 (AT&T, who acquired the Vyatta product line from Brocade in 2017) will no longer provide any code patches or accept support escalations for the device.

Customers that use the Vyatta 5400 need to migrate to an alternative solution (such as the {{site.data.keyword.vra_full}} (“VRA”, based on the Vyatta 5600) or the IBM Juniper vSRX offering) before 31 March 2019.   

For existing customers, the Configuration conversion service is no longer subsidized by IBM. Customers can submit a pricing request by sending an email to Wan clouds at services@wanclouds.net with the subject: "Request for Vyatta 5400 Configuration Conversion."

Customers requiring assistance with “hands-on” migration tasks can reach out to our IBM Cloud Migration Professional Services by e-mailing ibmcte@us.ibm.com. IBM Cloud worked to identify qualified IBM Business Partners who can assist. These engagements are on a fee-based model, through a direct contract between the customer and the Business Partner.
